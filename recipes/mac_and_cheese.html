            <li>2 large onions, very thinly sliced </li>
            <li>1 teaspoon dried thyme</li>
            <li>1 bay leaf</li>
            <li>1 pinch salt and ground black pepper to taste </li>
            <li>1 (16 ounce) package elbow macaroni </li>
            <li>2 tablespoons all-purpose flour </li>
            <li>1 cup milk </li>
            <li>1 pinch freshly grated nutmeg, or to taste</li>
            <li>Â¾ pound shredded Gruyere cheese</li>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
        <li><p>Melt 2 tablespoons butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir onions, thyme, and bay leaf in the butter for 5 minutes; season with salt and pepper. Reduce the heat to medium-low and cook until onions are browned, 10 to 15 minutes. Transfer to a plate and discard the bay leaf. Reserve the skillet.</p></li>
        <li><p>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook elbow macaroni in the boiling water, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 8 minutes.</p></li>
        <li><p>Meanwhile, melt remaining butter in the reserved skillet over medium heat. Whisk in flour for 1 minute, then whisk in beef broth and milk and bring to a boil; season with nutmeg, salt, and pepper. Reduce heat and cook until thickened, about 5 minutes. Stir in Gruyere cheese until melted.</p></li>
        <li><p>Drain macaroni and toss with onion and sauce until well combined.</p></li>
